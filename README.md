I am a Cyber Security HND (BEng(Hons) Cyber Security and Forensics student (SCQF Level 8) with a profound passion and interest in technology.
From an early age, I have been captivated by the world of computers and networks as the sheer complexity and endless possibilities of these systems have always fascinated me.

## Objective

My enthusiasm for cybersecurity is driven by a profound comprehension of the topic and an unwavering aspiration to create a beneficial influence in this domain. I possess a firm grounding in the fundamental principles of computer science, encompassing programming, networking, and operating systems. Additionally, I am acquainted with diverse cybersecurity tools and methodologies, such as penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and incident response.
Apart from my academic pursuits, I derive great pleasure from delving into new subjects and engaging in self-directed learning activities. I am an enthusiastic learner who constantly seeks to broaden my knowledge and abilities beyond the confines of the classroom. As an illustration, I have established a personal laboratory at home where I can experiment with virtualization and containerization, IPS and IDS, as well as Linux. Lately, I have been engrossed in developing my own blog, which primarily focuses on providing tutorials on self-hosting and sharing cybersecurity news. I have been able to improve my skills and knowledge in these areas through this achievement, and I have also had the opportunity to share my insights with others. I am excited to keep following my passions and exploring new opportunities as I start my career in cybersecurity.
